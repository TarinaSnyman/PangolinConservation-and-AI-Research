# Evaluating the Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence in the Conservation of Pangolins

## Project Overview
This repository contains documents outlining a research project by Tarina Snyman (student ID: 601376) for the course RSH381 in 2025, focused on evaluating the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in the conservation of pangolins. The research aims to explore how AI technologies, such as machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning, can enhance efforts to protect pangolins, which are among the most trafficked mammals globally and face significant threats from poaching and habitat loss.

## Research Scope
The study will investigate the application of AI-driven tools, such as recognition models, drones, and camera traps, to improve pangolin monitoring, poaching detection, and habitat assessment. It will compare AI-based methods with traditional conservation techniques in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the research will address challenges, including limited datasets, species identification difficulties, and ethical concerns related to AI use in wildlife conservation.

## Objectives
- Assess the potential of AI to enhance pangolin tracking and conservation outcomes.
- Identify limitations and challenges in implementing AI-driven conservation methods.
- Evaluate ethical considerations associated with AI monitoring technologies.
- Compare AI-based approaches with traditional methods to determine their relative effectiveness.

## Significance
Pangolins are critically endangered, and their elusive nature makes them difficult to study and protect using conventional methods. This research seeks to determine whether AI can provide innovative, efficient, and ethical solutions to support pangolin conservation, contributing to global efforts to combat illegal wildlife trade and preserve biodiversity.

## Status
The research is ongoing and has not yet been completed. The documents in this repository outline the proposed study, including background literature, research questions, and planned methodologies, with results and conclusions pending further investigation.

## Notes
- The research draws on recent studies (2018â€“2025) and references the IUCN Red List to highlight the urgent need for effective pangolin conservation strategies.
- Future work will involve quantitative data collection, statistical analysis, and addressing technical and ethical challenges to ensure robust findings.
